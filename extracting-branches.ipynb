    "## 1. Branch Scanning\n",
    "\n",
    "Between 1 - 6 branches (dependent on branch size) were arranged in a group, orientated so that they would not touch each other or the ground, and scanned simultaneously. Branches were secured in the end of metal tubing and placed in buckets of sand to minimise movement. [qrDAR fiducial markers](https://github.com/philwilkes/qrdar) (akin to QR codes) were placed on the floor to allow identification of each branch in post-processing. The markers include a pattern of 4 retroreflective stickers (10 mm diameter) which were used to co-register scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between 4 - 6 scan positions (collectively known as a project), located around the branches, were used to capture each set of branches. At each position a single scan was performed with an angular resolution of 0.02$^\\circ$\n",
    "\n",
    "Branch scanning was done indoors to minimise the impact of wind which branch tips are *very* sensitive too."

    "\n",
    "## 2. Project registration\n",
    "\n",
    "<b><i>This section is quite specific to using a RIEGL scanner and the RiSCAN PRO software. At the end we require individual scans to be registered into a single point cloud with (at a minimum) \\[X Y Z scan_pos reflectance\\] fields.</b></i>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Identify locations of reflective dots on qrDAR markers\n",
    "\n",
    "Before importing scans into a project we want to identify the reflective dots on the qrDAR markers as coarse registration tie-points. This will require the installation of [qrDAR](https://github.com/philwilkes/qrdar). We will also need to convert our `.rxp` files to another format (ideally `.ply`). One options is to use PDAL<sup>[1](#notes)</sup>, see `./pdal` for a pipeline. Other options include using PCL.\n",
    "\n",
    "If using PDAL, a loop<sup>[2](#notes)</sup> can be used to convert all scans in a project to `.ply`\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir ply\n",
    "cd ply\n",
    "for rxp in $(ls ../ScanPos*/??????_??????.rxp); \n",
    "    do pdal pipeline pdal/rxp2ply.json --readers.rxp.filename $rxp --writers.ply.filename ${rxp%.*}.ply; \n",
    "done\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python python/find_dots.py <riproject_dir>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will generate a `./stickers` directory containg text files with sticker locations \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Create .riproject\n",
    "\n",
    "This step requires RiSCAN Pro (tested on version 2.9) and is therefore run on a Windows machine. First you will need to create a blank project (`blank.RiSCAN`), this is used a basis to insert your data into. \n",
    "\n",

    "```                        \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Open the created project and register scans as normal\n",
    "\n",
    "Now open the created project and register as normal. Tie points will have been populated so no need to search for these (although sometimes not always found) and scans has already been rotated to the correct orienation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>To make subsequent processing easier, select approximately the points that will be required for further processing i.e. a polygon that includes all branches, codes and some of the floor.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once registered, export scans as individual scans in .ascii format with the fields PID, X, Y, Z, Deviation, Reflectance and <u>Selected</u> fields to the `/ascii` directory (this will have been made when creating .RiSCAN project). Also export the SOP rotation matrix in `.dat` format to the `/matrix` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Combine scans into a single point cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is necessary as it (1) removes all points that were not selected (see previous step) and (2) populates a scan position field. To combine scans run\n",
